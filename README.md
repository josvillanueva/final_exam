This class was not my first expirience programming, I do not considere myself a fan but also not a hater. I belive being able to programm is a very useful skill that can help you a lot in the area you work or study. I belive the topics in this class were very interesting, knowing what forecast is about was the thing that had the most of my attention. I belive this is essential and as we see in class is very useful for business and the world in general, it helps to predict what will happen and of course is not perfect is a very acccurate. Wroking with phyton was fun for me and very easy, bulding the regression models was nice and I belive I will use it again in the future. In conlusiion, i liked the class and belived programming and stadistical thinking is key for business.
